Themimg for sway to let you implement a gruvbox, everforest, cyberpunk neon, solarized, nord, (or modified nord with some added visual punch to the terminal and waybar) look. Each theme includes sway, waybar, rofi, foot (and so all terminal applications) and mako, as well as a matching GTK theme

It should be fairly easy to swap between the 5 using the included theme-switcher bash script, which modifies all required configs in one go and reloads sway/mako

The required icon and GTK themes are stored in /Themes-other, but should be copied into /.icons and /.themes.
